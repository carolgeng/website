            This is a project done for CSCE 315 and allows users to order drinks, while managers and employees can also
            make certain changes to the data. Several accessibility features are also implemented, such as a magnifying
            glass and Google translate. Additionally, sign-on using OAuth can be used to make orders. This project was
            done in React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and PostgresSQL for the database.

        <h3> Sept - Dec 2023 </h3>
        <p>
            In the Fall 2023 semester, I worked on machine learning project with 4 others to help detect Freezing of
            Gait (FOG) Events for
            those who have Parkinson's Disease. This is done in partnership with the Michael J. Fox Foundation for
            Parkinson's Research, as we use data provided from them for our models.

        <h3> Jan - May 2023</h3>
        <p>
            This is the final project done for CSCE 310, Database Systems. It is made with PHP and HTML/CSS
            embedded within it and MySQL to create, read, update, and delete entries. It is also connected to a dynamic
            database complete with attributes and entities. Users can sign up and login with a email and password, and
            there are different permissions depending on if
            you're an admin, employee, or customer. To summarize what the site is used for, Restuarant 8 provides users
            with the ability to reserve tables, make orders, and rate their food.

        <p>
            In the MLH Fellowship Prep Program, I worked with students around the world in a fast-paced 3-week program.
            We had daily stand-up meetings, and collaborated on two projects with Jekyll, React, and git. The first
            project was a Portfolio that showcased all of our members, along with fun features and facts about us. The
            second project was a Weather App that gave up-to-date weather events, temperatures, and more.

        <h3> May 2022 - Aug 2022</h3>
        <p>
            In this program, I worked with Wayfair engineers using Rust in an open-source project called Tremor. As my
            first time working in
            open-source, this was a lot of fun as I got to learn about how software development works and how important
            version control was.

        <h3> Apr 2022 - Present</h3>
        <p>
            Project IRIS is a NASA funded start-up working on the development of an in-situ radiation shield for the
            lunar surface. It was first proposed in January 2022 under NASA’s Proposal Writing and Evaluation Experience
            (NPWEE) in L’SPACE Academy and ended up winning $10,000 in funding to be developed further. A team of 10
            scientists and engineers is currently coordinating meetings with NASA Advisors and Subject Matter Experts
            while also contacting other professionals of this field. Currently, I have been acting as the Engineering
            Subteam Lead for this project.
